# Computer vision course site
This is the git repo of my CV course site. **Check it out** at:
[https://yonichechik.github.io/Computer-Vision-Course-Site/](https://yonichechik.github.io/Computer-Vision-Course-Site/)

You can see raw source code and .ppt at [my other repo](https://github.com/YoniChechik/AI_is_Math#readme).

This site's tamplate is based on the beautiful tamplate of [Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll#readme).

## The course slides are inspired and partially taken from
1. Introduction to Computer Vision-CS5670, Spring 2019, Cornell Tech.
2. 6-385 Computer Vision, Spring 2019, Carnegie Mellon.
