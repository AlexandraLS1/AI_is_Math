Hi! 

If you are in this page than it means that you want to start learning computer vision!

The propose of this site is that you will be able to learn how to implement computer vision algorithms, and also learn the math behind it, because after all- **AI is Math**.

## FAQs
> What is this course is about?

The full table of content of the course can be found [here.](/pages/toc/)

> Are there any prerequisites to the course?

**Established math proficiency.** 
- This course **doesn't** assumes any knowledge in image/signal processing- basic undergrad algabra course is sufficient. 
- It **does** assumes that the reader knows it way around seemingly hard math (never be afraid of math).
- **Python** knowledge is an advantage, but if you can deal with the math you can deal with the code. **Matlab is deprecated...** If you are reading this, this course is a great time to switch to Python.

> Just give me the code. I don't need to know the math...
 
**Wrong.** ??????????????????

## How to start learning?
starting here is easy.

Each chapter of the course has it own slides, and the are accompanied with .ipynb (known as ipython notebooks or jupyter notebooks).
Jupyter notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to view and run python files (and others) that contain live code, equations, visualizations and more- **no need to install anything!**

If you also want to run the selected notebook- simply click on the 3 circles logo in the Jupyter notebook navigation bar.

### Download Python
If you wand to invested further or debug your code, here is how to install [Python, Pycharm & packages.](/pages/p_00_python_pycharm_installation/python_pycharm_installation/)
This is especially recommended if you want to try the exercises, since you'll probebly want to debug them without heavy use of print statements.
