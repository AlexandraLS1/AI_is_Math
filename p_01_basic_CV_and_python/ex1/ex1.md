# EX1

In each of the .py files [available here](https://github.com/YoniChechik/AI_is_Math/tree/master/p_01_basic_CV_and_python/ex1) there are instructions on what to do.

Colab links is also available for online solving:
- ex1.1 - basic python [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/YoniChechik/AI_is_Math/blob/master/p_01_basic_CV_and_python/ex1/ex1_1_basic_python.ipynb)
- ex1.2 - numpy and matplotlib [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/YoniChechik/AI_is_Math/blob/master/p_01_basic_CV_and_python/ex1/ex1_2_numpy_matplotlib.ipynb)
- ex1.3 - opencv [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/YoniChechik/AI_is_Math/blob/master/p_01_basic_CV_and_python/ex1/ex1_3_opencv.ipynb)

## Course submission
The result of the EX should be a typed report in which a small but complete explanation on the submitted code + resulted graphs/images (if exist).

The code should be commented or self-explanatory.
**Only** .py files and one pdf file should be sent in a .zip file with a title "HWXX_<student_ID>.zip" (for example: HW01_123456789.zip)

Submission is done separately but brainstorming is encouraged!

Submission is due in **EXACTLY** two weeks after publish of HW, but should take much less.

Do not copy! Do not cheat!

Best of luck!
