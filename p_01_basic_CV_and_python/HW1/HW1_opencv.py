# TODO: your goal is to build the pyramids in the forest!
#  Hints to think about:
#  - are the images the same size?
#  - are there pixels in the forest image that collide with pixel from the pyramids? how can we erase them easily?
#
#  TODO: this section can be done in 3-4 lines of nice looking code, try not to write more then 10 lines here.
