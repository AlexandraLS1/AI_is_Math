# HW1
In each of the attached .py files there are instructions on what to do.

The result of the HW should be a typed report in which a small but complete explanation on the submitted code + resulted graphs if exist.

The code should be commented or self-explanatory.
**Only** .py files and one pdf file should be sent in a .zip file with a title "HWXX_<student_ID>.zip" (for example: HW01_123456789.zip)

Submission is done separately but brainstorming is encouraged!

Submission is due in **EXACTLY** two weeks after publish of HW, but should take much less.

Do not copy! Do not cheat!

Best of luck!
